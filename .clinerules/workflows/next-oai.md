Review the @docs/OpenAI-EndPoint/OAI-LOG.md and update any task status that has changed. If there are unblocked incomplete tasks, resolve those and log their status in this document.

Resolve all errors if possible otherwise log them and the blocking conditions and when they will be resolved.
Run tests when you believe are complete and resolve any errors possible in this step. Aim for 85% coverage.
 Make use of the following terminal commands to complete the tasks:
```bash
