Analyze the @docs/PRD-TASKS-1.0.md file and the @docs/TODO.md to understand the requirements for the project and what tasks still remain. If there are unblocked incomplete tasks in the TODO, resolve those and log their status in their corresponding phase task document (/docs/phase{NUMBER}-tasks.md.).
Then begin implementation of the tasks. Resolve all errors if possible. Run tests when you believe are completed and resolve any errors possible in this step.  Find the previous phase md files and look for incomplete items that may depend on what you just completed. Finish their implementation after logging your findings to the current phase task document. You may utilize the previous phase tasks as a guide to complete the next phase tasks. Note any blocking requirements for incomplete tasks if there are any. Make use of the following terminal commands to complete the tasks:
```bash
mypy
pytest
```
