# Feature 02 — Goals and Objectives

Status: ⚠️ Incomplete

Purpose:
Translate PRD goals into concrete, testable objectives for an Ollama provider that cleanly integrates with the Core OpenAI Endpoint Layer while strictly conforming to OpenAI schemas and core standards.

Outcomes:
- Objectives mapped to the core’s provider interface and transport responsibilities.
- Explicit success metrics for schema conformance, resilience, and observability.
- TDD-ready task list with clear dependencies on core features.

Core Alignment:
- Provider methods must match the Core Provider Interface (Feature 04 in core): `list_models`, `create_embeddings`, `create_completion`, `create_chat_completion`.
- Transport/auth/validation is handled by the core; provider focuses on API mapping, timeouts, and error normalization to `ProviderError`.
- Non-streaming default for v1 unless explicitly extended; any `stream=true` behavior must be documented and tested.

Tasks:
1. Functional Objectives
   - Implement all required provider methods with strict type hints and OpenAI schema alignment on inputs/outputs.
   - Ensure one-for-one mapping fidelity to the Ollama REST API for each method.
   - Status: ⚠️

2. Mapping Completeness
   - Capture all mandatory and optional fields per endpoint (OpenAI side) and map to Ollama’s expected fields (including nested `options` for generation parameters).
   - Provide safe defaults for fields Ollama does not return (e.g., `usage` zeros), and document any TODOs.
   - Status: ⚠️

3. Robustness & Error Strategy
   - Normalize network/HTTP/timeouts to `ProviderError` without leaking internals.
   - Add defensive parsing for partial/malformed Ollama responses; fail closed with normalized errors.
   - Implement request timeouts using core config `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S`.
   - Status: ⚠️

4. Observability & Context
   - Propagate `request_id` from core correlation middleware into Ollama client for logging and headers when possible.
   - Structure logs with provider=ollama, method, path, status_code, duration_ms.
   - Status: ⚠️

5. Performance & Non-Streaming
   - Ensure async, non-blocking HTTP I/O with explicit timeouts.
   - Default non-streaming behavior; if streaming is requested, return documented error or TODO path consistent with core expectations.
   - Status: ⚠️

6. Success Metrics
   - Endpoint responses validated against OpenAI schemas in provider unit tests.
   - Mocked integration with core routes passes for all four endpoints.
   - Test coverage ≥ 85% for provider business logic.
   - Status: ⚠️

Dependencies:
- Core Feature 04 — Provider Interface.
- Core Feature 05 — Routing and Namespace Resolution.
- Core Feature 06 — Authentication and Headers Handling (transport-level).

Acceptance Criteria:
- Documented objectives tie directly to tests and mappings.
- Error normalization and timeouts are clearly specified and implemented.
- Logging includes request_id and provider fields; no secret leakage.

Test & Coverage Targets:
- Unit tests for each mapping and error path using mocked HTTP client.
- Integration tests via core routes with provider wired to Ollama client mocks.
- Coverage ≥ 85% for provider logic.

Review Checklist:
- Are objectives traceable to core features and PRD mappings?
- Is non-streaming stance clear and testable?
- Do metrics ensure real interoperability with core endpoints?
