# Feature 02 — Goals and Objectives

Status: ⚠️ Incomplete

Purpose:
Translate PRD goals into actionable engineering tasks to ensure the Core OpenAI Endpoint Layer is compliant with the OpenAI REST API, provider-agnostic, and scalable for future endpoints.

Outcomes:
- Concrete objectives decomposed into verifiable tasks.
- Clear traceability from PRD goals to implementation and tests.
- Alignment with modular architecture enabling fast provider integration.

Tasks:
1. Define Primary Functional Goal
   - Document the requirement to implement OpenAI-compatible endpoints (non-streaming scope for v1).
   - Establish a compatibility checklist per endpoint (models, embeddings, completions, chat completions).
   - Status: ⚠️

2. Define Architectural Goal
   - Capture the modular, provider-agnostic approach:
     - No core API code changes required to add a new provider.
     - Provider added via base interface implementation and configuration.
   - Create a provider integration guide template referenced by later features.
   - Status: ⚠️

3. Decoupling Objectives
   - Specify boundaries: routing/parsing/validation in core; provider logic behind an interface.
   - Define dependency injection path for providers in the app factory.
   - Status: ⚠️

4. Scalability Objectives
   - Document how new OpenAI endpoints (e.g., images, audio) will plug into the same patterns:
     - New schemas
     - New routers
     - Provider interface extension or new interfaces with composition
   - Status: ⚠️

5. Success Metrics
   - OpenAI schema conformance per endpoint (request/response).
   - Ability to swap provider implementations via config for integration tests.
   - Test coverage ≥ 85% across business logic.
   - Status: ⚠️

Dependencies:
- Feature 01 — Architecture overview.
- Feature 04 — Provider Interface.
- Features 07–10 — Endpoint features.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Written objectives aligned to PRD sections.
- Measurable success criteria and traceability to tests.
- A short “provider integration” outline exists for later elaboration.

Test & Coverage Targets:
- Validation through downstream endpoint/provider tests.
- Ensure coverage targets are achievable via unit + integration tests.

Review Checklist:
- Are objectives testable and mapped to later endpoint features?
- Does the decoupling objective preclude changes to core for new providers?
- Are success metrics objective and automation-friendly?
