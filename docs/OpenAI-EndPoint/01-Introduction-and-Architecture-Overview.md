# Feature 01 — Introduction and Architecture Overview

Status: ⚠️ Incomplete

Purpose:
Establish the high-level architecture and guiding principles for the Core OpenAI Endpoint Layer that is provider-agnostic, reusable, and compliant with OpenAI REST API standards. This feature aligns the project with the PRD’s modular goals and sets the foundation for subsequent endpoint and provider work.

Outcomes:
- Clear architectural diagram and narrative describing API layer, routing, provider abstraction, schemas, middleware, and error handling.
- Defined boundaries: in-scope behaviors for this layer vs. out-of-scope provider-specific logic.
- Shared terminology and conventions to be used across all features.

Tasks:
1. Architecture Narrative and Diagrams
   - Draft an architecture description covering:
     - Public API layer (FastAPI app factory, routers).
     - Routing mechanism using provider namespace segment: `/{provider}/v1/...`.
     - Provider abstraction (base interface and provider resolution).
     - Schemas (OpenAI-compatible request/response).
     - Middleware (auth, correlation ID, security headers, structured logging).
     - Exceptions and global error normalization.
     - Configuration via pydantic-settings and environment variables.
   - Produce a high-level diagram (ASCII or Mermaid) capturing components and data flow.
   - Status: ⚠️

2. Provider-Agnostic Design Principles
   - Document the principle of decoupling public endpoints from provider implementations.
   - Define extension strategy: adding a provider should require implementing the base interface and updating config only (no changes in core API).
   - State how additional OpenAI endpoints (images, audio) will be integrated in the future.
   - Status: ⚠️

3. Compliance Scope with OpenAI REST
   - Enumerate supported endpoints for v1:
     - GET `/{provider}/v1/models`
     - POST `/{provider}/v1/embeddings`
     - POST `/{provider}/v1/completions` (legacy)
     - POST `/{provider}/v1/chat/completions`
   - Specify the requirement to validate inputs and shape outputs to OpenAI schemas.
   - Status: ⚠️

4. Operational Considerations
   - Note stateless service design, horizontal scalability, and health/readiness endpoints (overall system assumptions; health endpoint may be outside this PRD’s scope but referenced).
   - Note timeouts and non-blocking async provider calls.
   - Status: ⚠️

5. Standards and Constraints Alignment
   - Reference project standards (Python 3.12, FastAPI, Pytest, MyPy, Ruff, Docker, VSCode, uv).
   - Confirm strict typing, linting/formatting, and TDD emphasis.
   - Status: ⚠️

Dependencies:
- Project-wide standards and configurations (pyproject.toml, pydantic settings).
- Provider base interface (Feature 04).
- Routing design (Feature 05).
- Middleware features (auth, correlation ID, security headers) from global standards.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A documented architecture overview exists with clear component boundaries and data flow.
- The provider-agnostic strategy is explained and testable by substituting providers.
- OpenAI endpoint compatibility scope is explicitly listed.
- Constraints (typing, linting, TDD) are acknowledged with traceability to standards.

Test & Coverage Targets:
- Documentation-only feature: tests are covered by downstream features that validate the architecture via integration tests (app factory, routers, DI). Aim to ensure subsequent features collectively keep overall coverage ≥ 85%.

Review Checklist:
- Does the overview prevent coupling between endpoints and provider specifics?
- Are future endpoints easily accommodated by the described architecture?
- Are responsibilities and boundaries clear to contributors?
