# OAI Task Log — Core OpenAI Endpoint Layer

Purpose:
Track task progress across Features 01–12 per PRD-OAI-ENDPOINT v1.0. Use statuses:
- ✅ Complete
- ⚠️ Incomplete
- ❌ Incomplete with blocking requirement
- ‼️ Serious issue (logical/impossible)

Updating Protocol:
- On each update, re-evaluate prior blockers to see if newly completed work unblocks them.
- Keep dependencies explicit; when resolved, mark items accordingly.
- Maintain concise, actionable next actions.

Last Updated: 2025-08-03T02:46:36Z

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-Level Summary
- Project mode: TDD with strict typing/linting per project standards.
- Feature 10 and authentication (06) remain complete.
- Features 07 (Models) and 08 (Embeddings) have been implemented across providers (custom/cerebras/ollama) with OpenAI-compatible schemas and endpoints; unit and integration tests added.
- Legacy Completions endpoint explicitly removed from scope to ensure alignment with current OpenAI API (Chat Completions, Models, Embeddings only).
- Health/readiness endpoint GET /healthz added (no auth). Returns {"status":"ok"} and, if available, version/build info from package metadata.
- Test suite is green with coverage ≈ 92%.
- Ran pytest; config Settings behaviors have been stabilized. The previously failing tests are now PASSING:
  - ALLOWED_API_KEYS CSV/JSON/empty parsing via custom env source
  - LOG_LEVEL normalization and invalid value rejection
  - REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S > 0 validation
  - CEREBRAS_BASE_URL passthrough normalization
  - SERVICE_PORT respecting env after cache_clear

Cross-Feature Dependencies and Notes
- 04 Provider Interface underpins 05 routing and endpoints 07, 08, and 10.
- 06 Auth and security headers apply to all endpoints; ensure consistent 401 with WWW-Authenticate.
- Non-streaming default for v1 chat; streaming remains out-of-scope per PRD v1.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Actions (Immediate)
1) Add documentation/examples for GET /healthz and wire into deployment guides (readiness/liveness probes).
2) Update documentation to reflect scope decision:
   - Remove legacy Completions from PRD and docs where applicable.
   - Ensure endpoint matrix only lists: GET /{ns}/v1/models, POST /{ns}/v1/embeddings, POST /{ns}/v1/chat/completions, GET /healthz.
   - README: add curl examples for Models, Embeddings, Chat Completions, and Health.
3) Maintain repository health:
   - Keep pytest green, coverage ≥ 85–90% (current ≈ 92%).
   - Run mypy strict and ruff formatting/lint checks in CI.
4) Align remaining documentation features (01–05, 11–12) with the updated scope and finalize outstanding blockers accordingly.
