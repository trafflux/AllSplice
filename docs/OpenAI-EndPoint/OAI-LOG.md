# OAI Task Log — Core OpenAI Endpoint Layer

Purpose:
Track task progress across Features 01–12 per PRD-OAI-ENDPOINT v1.0. Use statuses:
- ✅ Complete
- ⚠️ Incomplete
- ❌ Incomplete with blocking requirement
- ‼️ Serious issue (logical/impossible)

Updating Protocol:
- On each update, re-evaluate prior blockers to see if newly completed work unblocks them.
- Keep dependencies explicit; when resolved, mark items accordingly.
- Maintain concise, actionable next actions.

Last Updated: 2025-08-03T00:13:41Z

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-Level Summary
- Project mode: TDD with strict typing/linting per project standards.
- All 12 features exist as documentation scaffolds and are currently marked Incomplete in their respective files.
- Initial pass logs tasks and dependencies; implementation work will flip items to ✅ as code/tests/docs are added.
- Ran pytest; config Settings behaviors have been stabilized. The previously failing tests are now PASSING:
  - ALLOWED_API_KEYS CSV/JSON/empty parsing via custom env source
  - LOG_LEVEL normalization and invalid value rejection
  - REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S > 0 validation
  - CEREBRAS_BASE_URL passthrough normalization
  - SERVICE_PORT respecting env after cache_clear

Status: ⚠️
Dependencies: 01 Architecture overview.
Blockers: ❌ Traceability to tests requires endpoint behavior details (07–10) stabilized.

03 — Scope
Status: ⚠️
Dependencies: 01, 02, 04.
Blockers: ⚠️ Endpoint matrix pending consolidated schema references.

04 — Provider Interface Definition
Status: ⚠️
Dependencies: 01, 02, 03; OpenAI schema models.
Blockers: ⚠️ Needs schema mapping specifics and error normalization policy finalization.

05 — Routing and Namespace Resolution
Status: ⚠️
Dependencies: 01, 04; middleware and handlers.
Blockers: ⚠️ Provider registry/DI composition root details must align with config.

06 — Authentication and Headers Handling
Status: ✅
Dependencies: Global middleware, 05 routing for integration points.
Blockers: None. Auth dependency validated by tests; configuration parsing stabilized.

07 — GET /{provider}/v1/models
Status: ❌
Dependencies: 05 routing, 04 interface (list_models), 06 auth.
Blockers: Missing endpoint implementation and schemas for ListModels. PRD requires strict OpenAI schema compliance. Implementation work needed in routes, provider interface, and schemas.
