# OAI Task Log — Core OpenAI Endpoint Layer

Purpose:
Track task progress across Features 01–12 per PRD-OAI-ENDPOINT v1.0. Use statuses:
- ✅ Complete
- ⚠️ Incomplete
- ❌ Incomplete with blocking requirement
- ‼️ Serious issue (logical/impossible)

Updating Protocol:
- On each update, re-evaluate prior blockers to see if newly completed work unblocks them.
- Keep dependencies explicit; when resolved, mark items accordingly.
- Maintain concise, actionable next actions.

Last Updated: 2025-08-02T22:32:53Z

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-Level Summary
- Project mode: TDD with strict typing/linting per project standards.
- All 12 features exist as documentation scaffolds and are currently marked Incomplete in their respective files.
- Initial pass logs tasks and dependencies; implementation work will flip items to ✅ as code/tests/docs are added.
- Ran pytest; actively fixing config Settings behaviors. Remaining failing tests focus on:
  - ALLOWED_API_KEYS CSV parsing
  - LOG_LEVEL normalization/invalid values
  - REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S > 0 validation
  - CEREBRAS_BASE_URL passthrough
  - SERVICE_PORT respecting env after cache_clear

Cross-Feature Dependencies and Notes
- 04 Provider Interface underpins 05 routing and endpoints 07–10.
- 06 Auth and security headers apply to all endpoints; ensure consistent 401 with WWW-Authenticate.
- Non-streaming default for v1 across legacy and chat; explicit stance to be documented in 09 and 10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Actions (Immediate)
1) Config fixes (in progress):
   - ALLOWED_API_KEYS: custom Env source now returns JSON list and marks value as complex; default Env masked. Further tweak done to handle whitespace-only and preserve CSV splitting. Re-verify with tests.
   - LOG_LEVEL: validator normalizes to upper and raises on invalid; re-run tests.
   - REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S: validated in model_validator(mode="after") to be > 0; re-run tests.
   - CEREBRAS_BASE_URL: before-validator now returns None for blank and string for valid values; re-run tests.
   - SERVICE_PORT: enforced int cast in after-validator to respect env after cache_clear; re-run tests.
2) Run pytest and resolve any remaining failures, keeping coverage ≥ 85% (currently ~92%).
3) When green, sweep features 06, 11 for documentation updates and mark items complete in this log.

Changelog (for this log)
- 2025-08-02 22:32:53Z: Implemented Env masking for ALLOWED_API_KEYS, improved CSV/JSON handling, tightened LOG_LEVEL and timeout validators, ensured SERVICE_PORT casting, and CEREBRAS_BASE_URL passthrough. Preparing to re-run tests and finalize.
- 2025-08-02 22:29:46Z: Ran tests; remaining failures isolated to Settings parsing/validation (ALLOWED_API_KEYS CSV, LOG_LEVEL, REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S, SERVICE_PORT cache-refresh). Planned fix: mask ALLOWED_API_KEYS from default Env provider; verify validators.
- 2025-08-02 22:18:44Z: Executed pytest; logged failures and queued fixes for auth/config and defaults; updated next actions.
- 2025-08-02 22:06:28Z: Updated Feature 01 with architecture narrative + Mermaid diagram draft; adjusted blockers and next actions; refreshed timestamp.
- 2025-08-02: Initial creation of OAI-LOG.md with baseline statuses and dependency mapping.
