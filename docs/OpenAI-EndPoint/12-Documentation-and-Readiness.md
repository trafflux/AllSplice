# Feature 12 — Documentation and Readiness

Status: ⚠️ Incomplete

Purpose:
Define the documentation deliverables and readiness checks to ensure the Core OpenAI Endpoint Layer is understandable, operable in Docker + VS Code with uv, and verifiable via tests and coverage before declaring features complete.

Outcomes:
- Task lists for docs covering setup, environment variables, run/test commands, and endpoint usage.
- Readiness checklist that must be satisfied before a feature can be marked ✅.
- Cross-feature review to reconcile any blocking or incomplete tasks based on latest progress.

Scope:
- Engineering docs only; no GUI or provider implementations.
- Focus on how to run, test, validate endpoints, and interpret logs/errors.

Tasks:
1. Repository Docs Enhancements
   - Update README with:
     - Project overview and scope (link to Feature 03).
     - Tech stack and standards (link to Feature 11).
     - Local development using Docker + uv with `system = true`.
     - How to configure `.env` from `.env.example` (document ALLOWED_API_KEYS, SERVICE_HOST/PORT, REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S, ENABLE_SECURITY_HEADERS, etc.).
     - How to run app (development script/command) and health check endpoint location (if applicable).
   - Status: ⚠️

2. Endpoint Usage Examples
   - Add curl examples for:
     - GET `/{provider}/v1/models`
     - POST `/{provider}/v1/embeddings`
     - POST `/{provider}/v1/completions` (legacy)
     - POST `/{provider}/v1/chat/completions`
   - Include `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header, typical request bodies, and sample responses (schematic, not provider-specific).
   - Status: ⚠️

3. Provider-Agnostic Integration Guide (Stub)
   - Reference Feature 04 (Provider Interface) and Feature 05 (Routing).
   - Document how a new provider is integrated:
     - Implement interface, bind in app factory via config, add tests.
   - Emphasize no core changes required for new providers.
   - Status: ⚠️

4. TDD and QA Workflow
   - Document TDD steps referencing Feature 11:
     - Write failing tests for endpoint behavior and mapping.
     - Implement minimal logic in routes to pass tests (transport only).
     - Validate ruff, mypy, pytest with coverage ≥ 85%.
   - Provide typical uv commands for running tests and checks inside Dockerized environment.
   - Status: ⚠️

5. Operational Notes
   - Explain structured logging fields and where logs are emitted.
   - Redaction policy for secrets.
   - Timeouts and how to tune via env vars.
   - Status: ⚠️

6. Readiness Checklist (Per Feature)
   - All tasks in the feature are marked ✅ or properly marked ❌ with blocking reason or ‼️ if serious issue found.
   - mypy and ruff clean for the scope of the feature changes.
   - Tests passing locally with ≥ 85% coverage on affected areas.
   - Documentation updated (README and feature files).
   - Cross-feature review performed to resolve earlier feature blockers where possible.
   - Status: ⚠️

7. Cross-Feature Review Procedure
   - At completion of a feature:
     - Review Features 01–current for items marked ⚠️/❌/‼️.
     - If the new work unblocks any prior items, update their status and notes.
     - If new blockers are found, document in the affected feature with rationale and dependencies.
   - Status: ⚠️

Dependencies:
- Feature 01 — Architecture overview for context.
- Features 07–10 — Endpoint details for curl examples.
- Feature 11 — Standards and QA workflow for TDD and coverage.

Acceptance Criteria:
- README updated with run/test instructions using uv and Docker environment.
- Curl examples for all four endpoints include auth header and canonical payloads.
- Provider-agnostic integration guide stub created and linked from README.
- Readiness checklist published and used to gate feature completion.
- Cross-feature review process described.

Test & Coverage Targets:
- Documentation-driven; verified indirectly via successful local runs and CI.
- Coverage requirement (≥ 85%) reaffirmed and linked to execution commands.

Review Checklist:
- Are command snippets accurate for uv and Docker-based dev?
- Do curl examples reflect OpenAI schemas and required headers?
- Is the readiness checklist sufficient to prevent premature ✅ statuses?
