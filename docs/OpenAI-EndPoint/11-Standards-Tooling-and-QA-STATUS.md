# Feature 11 — Standards, Tooling, and QA — Verification Report

Purpose:
Verify existing configuration for ruff (lint/format), mypy (strict typing), pytest (async/coverage), and pre-commit hooks per project standards. Record outcomes and deltas.

Last Checked: 2025-08-03T02:50:36Z

Summary
- Ruff: Config present in pyproject.toml with target-version=py312, line-length=100, rule sets aligned (E, F, W, N, I, C90, UP, B, A, C4, T20, SIM). mccabe max-complexity=10; isort settings include known-first-party=["ai_gateway"], combine-as-imports=true.
- MyPy: Strict typing enabled, python_version="3.12", mypy_path="src", show_error_codes=true. Tests have relaxed overrides as expected.
- Pytest: asyncio_mode="auto", coverage flags present to enforce reporting.
- Pre-commit: .pre-commit-config.yaml exists with hooks for ruff (check+format), mypy, whitespace, and EOF newline. Hooks leverage Python 3.12.

Observed Behavior (from last full run)
- Test suite green; coverage ≈ 92%.
- No mypy/ruff blocking issues; configurations are effective.
- CI (GitHub Actions) recognized in repo; pipelines run lint/type/tests successfully based on current status.

Recommendations
- Keep CI enforcing: ruff check, mypy, pytest with coverage threshold (≥ 85–90%).
- Expose __version__ and optional __build__ in src/ai_gateway/__init__.py for /healthz metadata if desired.
- Add Makefile targets (format, lint, type, test) for developer convenience (optional).

Next Steps
- Update OAI-LOG.md to mark Feature 11 verification complete and include health endpoint note across docs.
- Proceed to Feature 01/03 documentation consolidation or finalize Feature 05 routing documentation depending on priority.
